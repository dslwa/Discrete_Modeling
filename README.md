# Discrete Modeling

## LAB01
This directory contains Python code for performing basic image processing tasks such as darkening, brightening, and binary thresholding using the Pillow library. The darkening function reduces the image's brightness by a user-defined percentage, while the brightening function generates multiple images with incremental brightness increases. The binary thresholding function converts the image to a binary format based on a fixed or user-defined threshold. Users can dynamically adjust the threshold during runtime to explore different binary outcomes. The code allows easy manipulation of grayscale images and saving the results to files.

## LAB02
The directory contains an implementation of contextual and morphological transformations in Python. It includes functions for dilation, erosion, opening, closing, and convolution operations with masks of varying radii. The code also supports loading masks from files and saving transformation results as image files.

## LAB03
The code implements a one-dimensional cellular automaton that evolves based on a set of rules derived from an album number. It supports both periodic and absorbing boundary conditions and saves the resulting automaton states to a CSV file. The user inputs the number of iterations and the boundary condition type, and the program simulates successive generations of the automaton
