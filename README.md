## LAB01
This repository contains Python code for performing basic image processing tasks such as darkening, brightening, and binary thresholding using the Pillow library. The darkening function reduces the image's brightness by a user-defined percentage, while the brightening function generates multiple images with incremental brightness increases. The binary thresholding function converts the image to a binary format based on a fixed or user-defined threshold. Users can dynamically adjust the threshold during runtime to explore different binary outcomes. The code allows easy manipulation of grayscale images and saving the results to files.
